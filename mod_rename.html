<hr>
<h3><a name="RenameEnable">RenameEnable</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> RenameEnable <em>on|off</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>, <code>.ftpaccess</code>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_rename<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.3.4rc1 and later

<p>
The <code>RenameEnable</code> directive can be used to disable the renaming
of files by <code>mod_rename</code> on a per-directory basis.

<hr>
<h3><a name="RenameEngine">RenameEngine</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> RenameEngine <em>on|off</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Global&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_rename<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.2 and later

<p>
The <code>RenameEngine</code> directive turns on or off
<code>mod_rename</code>'s renaming engine.  Use this directive to disable the
module, rather than commenting all <code>mod_rename</code> directives.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RenameFilter">RenameFilter</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> RenameFilter <em>regex|&quot;duplicate&quot;|&quot;none&quot; [filter-opts]</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>, .ftpaccess<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_rename<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.2 and later

<p>
The <code>RenameFilter</code> directive is used to configure a regular
expression that the name of a file being uploaded must match in order to
qualify for renaming.  If no <code>RenameFilter</code> is given, all uploaded
files are eligible to be renamed.

<p>
If the special filter &quot;duplicate&quot; is used, it means to apply the
renaming rules to the uploaded file only if that filename is a duplicate of an
already existing filename in that directory.

<p>
If the special filter &quot;none&quot; is used, it means that no filter must be
matched for the renaming rules to apply to uploaded files.  This is used to
remove any <code>RenameFilter</code>s inherited from parent directories.

<p>
The optional <em>filter-opts</em> parameter can be used to configure the
following filter options:
<ul>
  <li><b>IgnoreCase</b><br>
    Regex evaluation and duplicate searching will be case-insensitive<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RenameLog">RenameLog</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> RenameLog <em>file|&quot;none&quot;</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Global&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_rename<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.2 and later

<p>
The <code>RenameLog</code> directive is used to specify a log file for
<code>mod_rename</code>'s reporting on a per-server basis.  The <em>file</em>
parameter given must be the full path to the file to use for logging.

<p>
If no log file is given, the module will log messages at debug level 3.  If
the <em>file</em> given is &quot;none&quot;, no logging will be done at all;
this setting can be used to override a <code>RenameLog</code> inherited from a
<code>&lt;Global&gt;</code> context.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RenamePrefix">RenamePrefix</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> RenamePrefix <em>text|&quot;none&quot;</em> <em>[&quot;max&quot; count]</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>, .ftpaccess<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_rename<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.2 and later

<p>
The <code>RenamePrefix</code> directive is used to specify some <em>text</em>
that will be prepended to the name to which an eligible file is renamed
(<i>e.g.</i> &quot;/home/bob/tmpfile&quot; would become
&quot;/home/bob/new.tmpfile&quot; if <code>&quot;RenamePrefix new.&quot;</code>
was configured).

<p>
The special character <code>~</code> may be used in <em>text</em>.  It will be
expanded to the current username when files are renamed.

<p>
The special character <code>#</code> may be used in <em>text</em>.  It will be
expanded to a number when file are renamed.  This number is determined as
follows: if a file of the name that <code>mod_rename</code> wants to use
already exists, <code>#</code> will be set to &quot;1&quot;.  For example,
with <code>RenamePrefix #.</code>, if file &quot;foo&quot; is uploaded (and
already exists in the destination directory), the module will attempt to
rename the file to &quot;1.foo&quot;.  The next time file &quot;foo&quot; is
uploaded, it will be renamed to &quot;2.foo&quot; (assuming that file
&quot;1.foo&quot; has not been deleted in the meantime).

<p>
<b>Note</b> that when the <code>#</code> character is used, a maximum
<em>count</em> of renamed copies can be specified, <i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
  RenamePrefix #. max 10
</pre>
A <em>count</em> value of zero can be used to have the existing file
<em>deleted</em>, rather than being renamed or overwritten.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RenameSuffix">RenameSuffix</a></h2>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> RenameSuffix <em>text|&quot;none&quot;</em> <em>[&quot;max&quot; count]</em<br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>, .ftpaccess<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_rename<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.2 and later

<p>
The <code>RenameSuffix</code> directive is used to specify some <em>text</em>
that will be apppended to the name of the file to which an eligible file is
renamed (<i>e.g.</i> &quot;/home/bob/tmpfile&quot; would become
&quot;/home/bob/tmpfile.renamed&quot; if
<code>&quot;RenameSuffix .renamed&quot;</code> was configured).

<p>
The special character <code>~</code> may be used in <em>text</em>.  It will be
expanded to the current username when files are renamed.

<p>
The special character <code>#</code> may be used in <em>text</em>.  It will be
expanded to a number when the file is renamed.  This number is determined as
follows: if a file of the name that <code>mod_rename</code> wants to use
already exists, <code>#</code> will be set to &quot;1&quot;.  For example,
with <code>RenameSuffix .#</code>, if file &quot;foo&quot; is uploaded (and
already exists in the destination directory), the module will attempt to
rename the file to name &quot;foo.1&quot;.  The next time file &quot;foo&quot;
is uploaded, it will be renamed to &quot;foo.2&quot; (assuming that file
&quot;foo.1&quot; has not been deleted in the meantime).

<p>
<b>Note</b> that when the <code>#</code> character is used, a maximum
<em>count</em> of renamed copies can be specified, <i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
  RenameSuffix #. max 10
</pre>
A <em>count</em> value of zero can be used to have the existing file
<em>deleted</em>, rather than being renamed or overwritten.

<h2><a name="Usage">Usage</a></h2>
This module has absolutely no connection to the <code>RNFR</code> or
<code>RNTO</code> FTP commands.  It works by adjusting the name of the file
being <code>STOR</code>ed by the client behind the scenes, before the transfer
of the content of the file has started.  One of the consequences is that the
renamed path <i>may</i> run afoul of any configured <code>AllowFilter</code>,
<code>DenyFilter</code>, <code>PathAllowFilter</code>, or
<code>PathDenyFilter</code> directives, causing unexpected or unwanted
problems.  Please keep this in mind when configuring prefaces and suffices.

<p>
In the case where both <code>RenamePrefix</code> and <code>RenameSuffix</code>
are configured, <i>and</i> both configured strings contain the special
<code>#</code> character, <i>and</i> a file of the name to use exists, both
occurrences of <code>#</code> will be incremented.
